Based on the specific restrictions and conditions that apply to off-airport landings, a distinction is made in air navigation publications between 4 categories: 1. Game reserves 2. Mire landscapes 3. Floodplains 4. Other protected areas (raised and transition bogs, fens, water and migratory bird reserves, national parks). Each category of protected area is divided into two generalisation levels: in small-scale views, the protected areas are displayed for readability in generalised form and inversely proportional to area, with a lateral buffer of between 1 and 80 m. In the large-scale views, the perimeters of the protected site are displayed in the legally valid dimensions. Off-airport landings on other protected areas are not permitted, subject to Art. 19 para. 3 Art. 28. |  |  |  | Federal Office for the Environment FOEN |  | Other protected areas AuLaV",

The map was last updated in 1994 and a major revision is planned. The National Map 1:1 million is published in analogue format as a printed map and in digital format as the Swiss Map Raster. The printed map is available folded and unfolded. A special edition without lettering (only hydrography and hillshading) is available as an unfolded poster. The Swiss Map Raster is the digital National Map 1:1 million and is delivered as a georeferenced TIF file (raster format). The map content is separated into individual colour layers with no direct bearing on the individual map elements. The pixel map is available as a colour combination corresponding to fixed swisstopo standards (254 dpi and 508 dpi) or separated as colour layers (508 dpi). | Landeskarte 1:1 Mio. | swisstopo | Bundesamt f\u00fcr Landestopografie swisstopo | Federal Office of Topography swisstopo | swisstopo | National Map 1:1 million",
